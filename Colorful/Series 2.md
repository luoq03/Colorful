**Series 2 continues the discussion of color in Series 1. And on the basis of related cases, the sound interaction of keyboard keys and mouse interaction are added to make the picture more rich. In addition, it is more impactful in the sense of picture. Reminiscent of fluttering hair or fluttering prayer flags. This code initializes a sound file and an image file. It loads the 3D model of the ball and sets its position and scale. The code also sets up the environment for drawing the line by initializing the color list and position list vectors, using nested loops to store the position of the points in 3D space.
The update function updates the particle's position and generates a new line by adding new points to the ends of existing line segments. The draw function draws the image and rotates the camera before drawing the line in 3D space. The color and width of the lines change according to age.
Taken together, this code generates an interactive 3D environment with a particle system that generates lines.**
